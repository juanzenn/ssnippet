# ssnippet - code snippets you love

![code-snippet](/src/assets/snippet.png)

You wonder how to create a code snippet for your blog, Twitter post or any other resource? 

There are services available for that, but they lack customisation! Would you like to be able to set themes as you want it and not as it was designed by someone?

[ssnippet](ssnippet.app) is here for you! Predefined themes, full customisation and many more! 

**code it, ssnipp it, sshare  it**

**Build in progress**
